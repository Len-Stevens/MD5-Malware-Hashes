# MD5-Malware-Hashes
A .txt file containing the MD5 hashes for malware gathered from multiple sources, perfect if you want to build your own antivirus and need a list of signatures to get started.
I will be updating this repo with new hashes every so often so be sure to check back in at a later stage if you need more hashes :)

Thank You! :)
